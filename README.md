## Installation

```
sanity install documents-pane
```

This plugin is designed to be used as a [Component inside of a View](https://www.sanity.io/docs/structure-builder-reference#c0c8284844b7).

The example below illustrates using the current Document being used to query for all Documents that reference it.

```js
// ./src/deskStructure.js
import DocumentsPane from 'sanity-plugin-documents-pane'

// ...all other list items

S.view
  .component(DocumentsPane)
  .options({
    query: `*[!(_id in path("drafts.**")) && references($id)]`,
    params: {id: `_id`},
    useDraft: false,
    debug: true,
  })
  .title('Incoming References')
```

The `.options()` configuration works as follows:

- `query` (string, required)
- `params` (object, optional) A [dot-notated string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dlv) from the document object to a field, to use as variables in the query.
- `useDraft` (bool, optional, default: `false`) When populating the `params` values, it will use the `published` version of the document by default.
- `debug` (bool, optional, default: `false`) In case of an error or the query returning no documents, setting to `true` will display the query and params that were used.
